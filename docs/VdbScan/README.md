# Vision Database Scan Start Page

The main goal of `VdbScan.vis` is to alert teams using vision to problems in their databases before they become critical. The goal of this package is to raise alarm about issues in a database so that there is a week or more to work on implementing a solution BEFORE production is impacted.

# USAGE:
#   Run this report EVERY DAY if possible.  Any output from this script should
#   be evaluated per the instructions here:
#   https://vision-dbms.github.io/vision/VdbScan/
#
#   Most days this script will not produce any output.  We suggest scripting
#   around this script such that it sends an email to your vision developers
#   every day that it produces output.

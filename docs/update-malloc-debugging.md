## Build a reproducer

First, to reproduce the error, we had to find the `limit datasize` from the job that malloc-ed and then run it in a session connected to the appropriate version of the database.

It is important to note the run against an old version of the database because the update had subsequently completed; building new holdings takes more memory than overwriting holdings already in the database. It will also take at least some memory to profile the database.

```
% limit datasize 4000000
% batchvision -v 5099805
V> 20091016 evaluate: [ IVR Holdings doitFor: 20091016 asDate; ];
V> ?G
** MALLOC
% limit datasize 5000000
% batchvision -v 5099805
V> 20091016 evaluate: [ IVR Holdings doitFor: 20091016 asDate; ];
V> ?G
V> "starting investigation" printNL;
```

## Run your reproducer in a "bigger" session 

Then you can see above that you simply bump the `limit datasize` in another session with your reproducer.  This results in a running session where you can look at the structures that your update has modified!

## Survey the big structures

This query quickly shows you how much memory the big containers are using:

```
^tmp define: 'bigContainerCount' toBe: 10;

!bigContainers <- AdminTools objectSpaceList
  extendBy: [ !bc; !os <- ^self; ] .
  iterate: [
    :bc <- os containerList
      select: [ (containerAddrType > 0) ] .
      sortDown: [ containerSize ] .
      first: ^tmp bigContainerCount ;
  ] .
  collectListElementsFrom: [ bc ] .
  reject: [ containerSize isNA ] . # optional but usually helpful
  sortDown: [ containerSize ] .
  first: ^tmp bigContainerCount;

bigContainers do: [
    displayContainerInfo;
  ] .
  total: [ containerSize ] . printWithCommasNL: 20;
```
_**TIP:** In large databases you may want to do this query only on the object spaces that you know are impacted by the load.  Iterating through each object spaces containerList can take a very long time and use memory in a session that won't be reclaimed_

## Which business objects do the containers belong to?

This query will give you tips as to what properties the biggest containers belong to:

```
bigContainers first: 4 . iterate: [ 
  "=" fill: 60 . printNL; 
  "Container: " print;
  ^self displayContainerInfo;
  newLine print;
  ^self displayLocalVisionReferents;
  newLine print;
];
```

The `_totalMarketValue`, `_shares` and  `holdingsSeries` taking up most of the memory from a holdings load is pretty much what one would expect.  But an update was unexpectedly using too much memory these techniques would be the exact techniques would use to begin to figure out why.

# Memory Usage Nuances

## Container Table Traversal

Container Table traversal uses up memory that can't be reclaimed by a session.  This query demonstrates this phenomenon effectively:

```
"Before:" printNL;
AdminTools displayMemoryStats;

AdminTools objectSpaceList iterate: [ containerList ];

newLine print;
"After Traversal:" printNL;
AdminTools displayMemoryStats;

Utility collectSessionGarbage;

newLine print;
"After collectSessionGarbage:" printNL;
AdminTools displayMemoryStats;
```

You can see that the 427MB used by the traversal can't be reclaimed by a `collectSessionGarbage`:
```
  Current allocation level:         80,892,443
  Session maximum:                  80,906,379
  Heap limit:                   10,240,000,000
  Total size of mapped segments    340,008,248

After Traversal:
  Current allocation level:        427,029,603
  Session maximum:                 471,514,023
  Heap limit:                   10,240,000,000
  Total size of mapped segments356,799,206,488

After collectSessionGarbage:
  Current allocation level:        427,029,603
  Session maximum:                 471,514,023
  Heap limit:                   10,240,000,000
  Total size of mapped segments356,825,094,992
```

## Entity Creation memory spikes

Often there are many large properties off of key Entities such as `Security` or `Account`.  Creating a single entity here can often take much more memory than one might expect:

```
"Before:" printNL;
AdminTools displayMemoryStats;

Security createInstance

newLine print;
"After:" printNL;
AdminTools displayMemoryStats;
```

Creating a single security instance takes 500MB of memory
```
Before:
  Current allocation level:          2,641,712
  Session maximum:                   2,659,968
  Heap limit:                    2,684,354,560
  Total size of mapped segments     18,833,024

After:
  Current allocation level:        482,271,800
  Session maximum:                 482,273,068
  Heap limit:                    2,684,354,560
  Total size of mapped segments    784,757,728
```

## AdminTools displayMemoryStats

In case you don't have this method in your database:

```
AdminTools respondsTo: 'displayMemoryStats' . ifFalse: [ 
  AdminTools define:'sessionAllocationHighWaterMark' toBePrimitive: 600 withControlValue: 1;
  AdminTools define:'sessionAllocationResourceLimit' toBePrimitive: 600 withControlValue: 2;
  AdminTools define:'sessionMappedAddressSpaceLevel' toBePrimitive: 600 withControlValue: 3;

  AdminTools defineMethod: [|displayMemoryStats|
    "  Current allocation level:    " print;
    totalNetworkAllocation printWithCommasNL: 15.000000;
    "  Session maximum:             " print;
    sessionAllocationHighWaterMark printWithCommasNL: 15.000000;
    "  Heap limit:                  " print;
    sessionAllocationResourceLimit printWithCommasNL: 15.000000;
    "  Total size of mapped segments" print;
    sessionMappedAddressSpaceLevel printWithCommasNL: 15.000000;
  ];
];
```

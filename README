Welcome to Open Source Vision

Web documentation: https://vision-dbms.github.io/vision/ 

Basic compile and install instructions are in the Install.Sandbox.  For
production processing customers expecting to use Vision as a part of one or
more production processes we recommend the setup in Install.Admin.

Install.Sandbox will result in compiled software in your git repo, and one or
more vision databases built from bootstrapping instructions and then installed
in your non repo account.  These are suitable for use as is.

Install.Admin will also result in compiled software and one or more vision
databases ("vdb").  In addition the instructions will guide the install to
separate the run time executables and vision bootstrap protocol from the git.
The account will become a central production application that can service one
or more applications using a localized localvision/network as the updatable
vdb.

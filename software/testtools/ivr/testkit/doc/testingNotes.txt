IVR Testing Notes

   * Types of Testing
      * Primarily Code
         * unit tests: Small tests with well defined inputs and outputs, 
           designed to test a small unit of code
         * functional tests: Higher level behavioral tests of user level 
           actions.  
         * performance tests: Tests the performance of a given portion of 
           code.  Specific to the box.
      * Data/Production Tests
         * system tests: Compare one database (with one codebase)
           to another database with different code for no harm done
           comparisons.
            * Needs two databases and a comparison script
         * mutation tests: running all tests on a variety of databases
           to determine 

   * Features needed for effective automated testing
      * Fixtures: Data/setups for tests, re-usable
      * mocks: Objects that impersonate other objects

      * Assertions: Easy ways to do make tests work
         * Output comparison of the test
         * AssertNA
         * AssertIsntDefault

   * What is an error and how do you test it?
      * Tests can be written to verify precise, specific conditions.  Good
        tests can verify lots of specific 

   * Random Thoughts
      * Do we need to have dynamic and non-dynamic fixtures
         * Sure, why not.  .txt files are easy :)
      * Can we have transactional fixtures?

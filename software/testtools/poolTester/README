Pool Tester README

INTRODUCTION

This utility is designed to aid in automated/routine testing of vpool and associated utilities.

USAGE

See on-line help.
    
CONFIGURATION

The following environment variables can be used to override configuration defaults. In addition to these, environment variables used by vpool and associated programs can also be manually defined/overwritten. For a list of all configuration variables including default values, see include/config.sh.

Tools: Where to find executables.
NDFPathName: Path to the Vision network used for each worker.
 
RUNTIME DEPENDENCIES

In order to start pools with workers, a Vision network is necessary. By default, a usable network is expected in $HOME/vision-testtools/scratch/testNetwork-`uname`/NDF. In most cases, any network will do, since workers are typically not expected to actually query the network for any useful data.

In order to use vcatool, said utility must be available in your $PATH.

DEVELOPER DOCUMENTATION

Additional operations can be added to the include directory by creating a new .sh file there and defining within it a function named after your new operation. This function must then be followed by an appropriate call to register_operation. You are also encouraged to provide a <operation>_help function in the same file. Operations should always begin with a lowercase alpha character.
